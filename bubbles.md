# Sliding Through Time on a Bubble Cloud

Sometimes bubbles aren't enough. They are playful, they're bouncy, but sometimes you need more. If you want more movement, transitions, excitement, and drama, then this tutorial just might be for you.

Here we will add the element of time to our beloved Bubble Cloud.

<div class="warning">
<p>WARNING: Bubbles my be harmful to your health.</p>
<p>Bubbles aren't always the best visual encoding for your data. While they are fun and can look good, there is a limit to how well people can decode differences in values when they are encoded in bubbles. Just keep this in mind as you experiment - and stay safe.</p>
